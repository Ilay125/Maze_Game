The Maze Gaem

A maze game based on a maze generator that
uses the recursive backtracking algorithm.

Made for the Timathon - Code Jam competition
by iLay#1272 && I live on saturn#6795

The game file is called: "Gaem.py"

You need to have python 3 and pygame (the code is written in python 3.7).

However, if you wish to see how the algorithm
works, you should check out the file "Test.py" in the
Tests folder.

In the main file you have two buttons:

Start - will start the main game.

Custom - will let you create your own maze.

Above 150x150 starts to be really heavy on the pc -
the game might crash.

The goal of the main game is to press all of the buttons
and go to the trapdoor under the time limit.

Difficulty names:

Medium - Ehh.. average

Hard - MY PP 

Ultimate - EPIK GAMER
